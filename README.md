Topological groups are blends of groups and topological spaces with the property that the multiplication and inversion operations are continuous functions. 
They frequently occur in mathematics and physics, e.g. in the form of Lie groups. This project is a formalization of topological groups for the theorem prover Isabelle.
 It contains basic properties of topological groups as well as their uniform structures. The most notable formalized result is the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem 
 which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the metrizability of a topological group. Examples for topological groups, such as the general linear group, are also included.
